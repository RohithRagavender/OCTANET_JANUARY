            <p>"What About Us" is a song recorded by the American singer-songwriter Pink for her seventh studio album
                Beautiful Trauma (2017). RCA Records released the song for digital download and streaming on August 10,
                2017, as the album's lead single. The song, which was written by Pink, Johnny McDaid, and its producer
                Steve
                Mac, is an electronic dance music (EDM) track with upbeat dance production that blends repetitive
                chords,
                synthesizers, and drum machine beats. Pink, who was inspired by the politics of the time, composed it as
                a
                political protest song with poetic and inclusive lyrics. The song's lyrics explore Pink's belief that
                the
                United States' government had failed its people and send a message about those who feel unheard or
                forgotten.

                Music critics gave "What About Us" mostly positive reviews; many of them commended the production and
                Pink's
                vocal performance while others appreciated the song's political message and the anthemic nature of the
                composition. It peaked at number 13 on the US Billboard Hot 100 and gave Pink her record-breaking ninth
                number-one song on the Adult Pop Songs chart, surpassing Katy Perry as the soloist with the most
                chart-topping songs on the chart. The song also reached number one on the national charts of eight
                countries, including Australia, Poland and Switzerland, and peaked within the top 10 in 12 other
                territories, including Canada and the United Kingdom. "What About Us" was nominated for Best Pop Solo
                Performance at the 60th Annual Grammy Awards.</p>
